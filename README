Procedural Star System Generator
================================

Phase 1: Star Generation

The initial phase of the development of this program will focus exclusively on the generation of plausible stars. While higher-order systems will be introduced in phase 2, it is not currently considered.

Note that PSSG now requires the GNU Scientific Library. The package on Ubuntu is `libgsl-dev`; however, your mileage may vary on other distributions or systems.

Compilation instructions:

`cd scripts; ./genver.sh; ./build.sh`
